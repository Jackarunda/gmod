ENT.Information	="The United States Military's M18A1 Claymore mine is a direction APERS (anti-personnel) munition that blasts its target \nwith a hail of steel ball bearings propelled by a pad of C3 explosive backed with a heavy steel plate. \nIt has no inherent fuzing mechanism, and 60 degree killzone and will shred soft targets out to 50 meters. Its \nlittle metal scissor legs can be stuck into any dirt or even wood, and on hard surfaces they will \nsimply keep the mine upright."

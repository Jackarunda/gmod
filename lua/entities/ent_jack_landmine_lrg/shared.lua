ENT.Information		="Jackarunda Industries general-purpose disc contact mine. A hardened steel container with a pat of concentrated high explosive, \nthis mine also has heat-activated glue pads which it engages upon arming to glue itself to whatever surface it rests on. \nAnother remarkable aspect of this device is its triggering mechanism: very sensitive to the touch, but will resist \nany high-speed impulses, such as those from explosion shockwaves and bullet impacts. The trigger will only respond to \npressure of a substantial duration (at least 100 milliseconds), such as that exerted when a large object touches the mine. \nThe mechanism is also completely mechanical, meaning it can lie undisturbed for years and still function perfectly \nat any moment. There is an electronic system, but it is merely the system for lighting the two LEDs on the mine and \nfor activating the glue heating coil. This is the medium-sized landmine, suitable for attacking soft targets and \nlight armor alike."

But what if the enemy shoves gas in your base?
Answer: Gas Mask and some cleanup procedures!

Almost every item you can think of, will either effect how successful a base defense is, or put said defense to the test.
Because if all the enemy has to use to fight said base is a gun, or maybe some explosives, you're just making the base defender's job easier.

You want to tear gas or nerve gas a fool? Do that!
If they cant handle it, they're ill-prepared and need to prepare better for it next time.

You want a more "cloak & dagger" playstyle? Wear some hulking, slow moving body armor suit that makes you invisible to a sentry's targeting system, and maybe disable them.

A-hole put mines everywhere? Put on a EOD suit, and grab a defusal kit and mine detector and go to town!

Dude using the radio to bomb the shit out of you? Focus on jamming his connection until he forgets he can even use an airstrike.

Want to eavesdrop on that pesky base you plan to take out? Pop a sticky micro-camera in there or point a directional mic at the base to find out what's up.

Dipshit just wearing heavy-built armor to raid your base? Crush him with a prop trap, his armor cant protect him against weight. 
Or, just tear gas him, he has to decide whether he uses his suit or a gasmask. 
Maybe a tripwire that, once set, unfreezes a prop, Like a log trap, or a real sturdy tripwire that makes the a-hole LITERALLY trip over it. Imagine how long it takes to stand up with several 100 pounds of armor on you!
The possibilities are endless.

Want to go full anarchist and torch a guy out? Molotovs.
Fellow anarchist torching you out? Fire suit.

Can't find the dude who keeps trying to raid you? Radar scan!
Want to find a asshole to raid? Also radar scan!

No matter how much you add to base defense, there's little change without base offense.
Most Gmod players will just storm you constantly with guns if they don't have some unique helping tools at their disposal.
Having equal amounts for both raider tools and base tools will keep the battles balanced, and mostly fair.
Tip it too much on one side or another, however, and it easily dumbs down or frustrates the whole idea of either attacking or defending a base.

Maybe some sort of dirty bomb to irradiate a base?

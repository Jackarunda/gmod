Jackarunda 1/24/2018: make the addon not shit
TheWarKid 1/25/2018: A control pannel in J.I Defense, that has control over all the turrets it's linked to. It holds the whitelist for who not to shoot. Capture that, and it removes everyone but the person who captured it from the whitelist. This makes it so the Turrets and users have something to defend, while allowing multiple people not to get shot by the turrets, allowing for more people in a location that needs defending.

Your hacks seem to work perfectly on zombies, but they dont target anything else. Not sure if thats on purpose or not.
The superhack gave me this error after a while                                                                              [ERROR] addons/gmod-192d9042d7394a23caac24cb8e3773e1fcb65503/lua/effects/eff_jack_gmod_thrustsmoke.lua:138: Tried to use invalid object (type CLuaEmitter) (Object was NULL or not of the right type)

It happened every time a specific hack attacked, and it only happened in that area
Scratch that, it only happens in one specific area, doesent matter which superhack is there
Gunship moves around dropping mines every few seconds, that seems to work. If its sporadic movements give it line of fire to a zombie it will shoot them. Otherwise it does nothing
Some problems from the latest version are still there, like spawner zombies still dropping headcrabs, and headcrab canisters dropping an insane amount of headcrabs.
Roller bomb ALSO only attacks zombies, and the no-friendly-fire ai thing also works
